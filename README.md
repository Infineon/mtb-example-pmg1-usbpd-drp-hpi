- Fault protection
   - VBUS overvoltage protection (OVP) in source and sink roles
   - VBUS overcurrent protection (OCP) in source role
   - VBUS reverse-current protection (RCP) in source role
   - VBUS short-circuit protection (SCP) in source role
   - VConn overcurrent protection (VConn OCP)
- Deep sleep operation
   - Places the PMG1 devices in low-power mode by entering into deep sleep when the system is idle state


The EZ-PDtrade; PMG1 MCU devices support a USBPD block that integrates Type-C terminations, comparators, and the Power Delivery transceiver required to detect the attachment of a partner device and negotiate power contracts with it.

On reset, the USBPD block is initialized with the following settings:

   - The receiver clock input of the block is connected to a 12 MHz PERI-derived clock.

   - The transmitter clock input of the block is connected to a 600 kHz PERI-derived clock.

   - The SAR ADC clock input of the block is connected to a 1 MHz PERI-derived clock.

   - The SAR ADC in the USBPD block is configured to measure the VBUS_TYPE-C voltage through an internal divider.

This application uses the PDStack middleware library in a DRP role.

**Figure 1. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/usbpd_drp_flow.png" width = "400"/>
<br>

The PDStack middleware library configures the USBPD block on the EZ-PDtrade; PMG1 MCU device to detect Type-C connection state changes and USB PD messages, and notify the stack through callback functions. The callback function registers the pending tasks, which are then handled by PDStack through the `Cy_PdStack_Dpm_Task` function. This function is expected to be called at appropriate times from the main processing loop of the application.

The solution layer provides the necessary HPI context data structure and callbacks. These callbacks enable the HPI middleware library to perform solution-specific operations as needed. The `Cy_Hpi_Task` handles the register read and write operations, and it also asserts the interrupt GPIO to notify the host processor or EC upon receiving asynchronous PD events or responses. It is essential to call this function from the main processing loop of the application.

**Figure 2. PDStack task flowchart**

<img src = "images/pdstacktask.png" width = "600"/>

<br>

The PDStack middleware library implements the state machines defined in the [USB Type-C Cable and Connector](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-20) and the [USB Power Delivery](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery) specifications. PDStack consists of the following main modules:

- **Type-C Manager:** Responsible for detecting a Type-C connection and identifying the type of connection. It uses the configurable Rp/Rd terminations provided by the USBPD block and the internal line state comparators. The Type-C Manager implements the state machines defined in the [USB Type-C Cable and Connector](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-20) specification and provides the following functionality:

    - **Manage CC terminations**: Applies Rp/Rd terminations according to the port role

    - **Attach detection**: Performs the required debounce and determine the type of device attached

    - **Detach detection**: Monitors the CC line and VBUS for detecting a device detach

- **Protocol Layer:** Forms the messages used to communicate between a pair of ports/cable plugs. It is responsible for forming capabilities messages, requests, responses, and acknowledgements. It receives inputs from the Policy Engine indicating which messages to send and relays the responses back to the policy engine.

- **Policy Engine:** Provides a mechanism to monitor and control the USB Power Delivery system within a particular consumer, provider, or cable plug. It implements the state machines defined in the *USB Power Delivery* specification and contains implementations of all PD Atomic Message Sequences (AMS). It interfaces with the protocol layer for PD message transmission/reception for controlling the reception of message types according to conditions such as the current state of the port. It also interfaces with the Type-C Manager for error conditions like Type-C error recovery.

- **Device Policy Manager (DPM):** Provides an interface to the application layer to initialize, monitor, and configure the PDStack middleware operation. The DPM provides the following functionality:

    - Initializes the Policy Engine and Type-C Manager

    - Starts the Type-C state machine followed by the Policy Engine state machine

    - Stops and disables the Type-C port

    - Allows entry/exit from deep sleep to achieve low power based on the port status

    - Provides APIs for the application to send PD/Type-C commands

    - Provides event callbacks to the application for application-specific handling

The PDStack library uses a set of callbacks registered by the application to perform board-specific tasks such as turning the consumer/provider power path ON/OFF and identifying the optimal source power profile to be used for charging. In this example, these functions are implemented using the appropriate APIs provided as part of the Peripheral Driver Library (PDL).

The stack also provides notification of various connections and PD policy state changes so that the rest of the system can be configured as required.

The application tries to keep the EZ-PDtrade; PMG1 MCU device in deep sleep, where all clocks are disabled and only limited hardware blocks are enabled, for most of its working time. Interrupts in the USBPD block are configured to detect any changes that happen while the device is in sleep, and wake it up for further processing.

An overvoltage (OV) comparator in the USBPD block is used to detect cases where the power source is supplying incorrect voltage levels and automatically shut down the power switches to protect the rest of the components on the board.

- **Host Processor Interface (HPI):** The HPI middleware implements the HPI transport, protocol, register, and Power Delivery (PD) message handling. It allows the host processor or EC to monitor the status of the USB PD ports, change configuration, perform firmware updates, and transparently interact with other connected PMG1 and CCGx USB PD devices. It provides the following key functionalities:
   - Firmware version identification
   - Firmware update capability
   - Reporting of Type-C and USB PD connection status
   - Interrupt-based event reporting when connection status changes
   - Control USB PD power profiles


### Flash memory map

The internal flash of PMG1 device is used to store a bootloader image, firmware images with their corresponding metadata.

**Figure 3. Flash layout**

<img src = "images/flash_memory_map.png" width = "800"/>
<br>

A fixed 7168 bytes of memory at the start of the flash space is allocated for the bootloader image and last two rows of the flash memory is allocated for the application metadata.
The remaining space is used by the application firmware.

The PMG1 devices PMG1-S0, PMG1-S1, and PMG1-S2 supports only single application firmware whereas the PMG1-S3 supports both single and dual application firmware architecture.

### PDStack library selection

The USB Type-C Connection Manager, USB Power Delivery (USB PD) protocol layer, and USB PD device Policy Engine state machine implementations are provided in the form of pre-compiled libraries as part of the PDStack middleware library.

Multiple variants of the PDStack library with different feature sets are provided; you can choose the appropriate version based on the features required by the target application.

In this application, the *PMG1_PD3_DRP* library with support for USB PD Revision 3.2 messaging and DRP SPR operation is chosen for PMG1-S1, PMG1-S2, and PMG1-S3 devices whereas *PMG1_PD3_DRP_LITE* is chosen for PMG1-S0.


### USBPD port configuration

The properties of the USB-C port including the port role and the default response to various USBPD messages can be configured using the EZ-PD&trade; Configurator Utility.

These parameters have been set to the appropriate values for a Power Delivery DRP application by default. To view or change the configuration, click on the **EZ-PD&trade; Configurator 2.0** item under **Tools** in the Quick Panel to launch the configurator.

**Figure 4. USB Type-C port configuration using EZ-PD&trade; Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_port_info.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

Properties of the USB-C port are configured using the *Port Information* section. Because this application supports the DRP role, the **Port Role** must be set as **Dual Role** and **DRP Toggle** must be enabled. Other parameters such as **Manufacturer Vendor ID** and **Manufacturer Product ID** can be set to the desired values.


**Figure 5. Sink capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_sink_pdo.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The power capabilities supported by the application in the sink role are specified using the *Sink PDO* section. See the [USB Power Delivery](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery) specification for details on how to encode the various sink capabilities. A maximum of seven PDOs can be added using the configurator.

**Figure 6. Source capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_source_pdo.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The power capabilities supported by the application in the source role are specified using the *Source PDO* section. See the *USB Power Delivery* specification for details on how to encode the various source capabilities. A maximum of seven PDOs can be added using the configurator.

**Figure 7. Extended sink capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_skedb_info.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The *SKEDB* section is used to input the extended sink capabilities response that will be sent by the application when queried by the power source. See the Power Delivery specification for details on the extended sink capabilities format.

**Figure 8. Extended source capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_scedb_info.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The *SCEDB* section is used to provide the extended source capabilities to the power sink device. See the *USB Power Delivery* specification for details on the extended source capabilities format.

Once the parameters have been updated as desired, save the configuration and build the application.
